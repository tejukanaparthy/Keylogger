# Keylogger

This is a simple keylogger created in Python that captures keystrokes and logs them to a file. It uses the `keyboard` and `pynput` libraries to capture keyboard events.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

### Requirements

Before running the keylogger, you need to install the required dependencies.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.


        git clone <repository_url>
        cd <project_directory>
3. Install the dependencies using pip:
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
This will install the required libraries: keyboard, pynput.

## Running the Keylogger
To run the keylogger, simply execute the Python script:
        python keylogger.py
The keylogger will start logging your keystrokes and save them to a file named keylog.txt.

## Stopping the Keylogger
To stop the keylogger, press Esc on your keyboard.
